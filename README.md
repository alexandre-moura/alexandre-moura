Hey there!

I'm Alexandre, and I'm a tech and music lover. Currently, I'm steering the ship as the Junior Developer Lead at Banco do Brasil, working on an app that's going to change how we use public transport in Latin America. Here you'll find some of my side projects I work on for personal use or just for fun

What I'm Good At

Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS.
Mobile Development: I bring ideas to life with React Native, TypeScript, and I also tinker with iOS apps.
Backend Integration: Connecting the dots with Node.js and Python
Tools: Xcode and Firebase are my playgrounds, and I'm getting pretty good at making designs in Figma.
Generative AI: Playing around with GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 to see what crazy stuff they come up with next.

Currently

Banco do Brasil, Brasília, DF
Junior Developer Lead at SPID (2022 - Present)
Here, I'm part of an awesome team that's as excited as I am about making our app a household name. My day-to-day? It's a mix of coding, crisis solving, and making sure our user experience is on point.
Cool Stuff I've Worked On

SPID Public Transport App
Lead Developer - I'm leading the charge on this React Native app that's set to transform how Brazilians travel. It's about pushing boundaries, integrating new tech, and continuously improving. And yes, it's as cool as it sounds.

Off the Clock

When I'm not coding, I'm really into music production and working out - I love running and working out. I also write a lot about whatever curiosity has taken hold of me for the week on twitter and my Substack, you can check those out!

Languages

Fluent in Portuguese and English, know a bit of Spanish and German as well.
